				At the end, things didn't work out as expected, 
				and we decided to go our separate ways and put 
				an end to Generativa. It was two amazing years, 
				full of learning and growth. The friendship and 
				respect remain stronger than ever, and we will 
				probably collaborate again in the future. I'm 
				looking forward to applying the understanding I 
				gained in the startup to the next level.
